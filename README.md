# JuDGE: Benchmarking Judgment Document Generation for Chinese Legal System

📢 **News: this work has been accepted at the SIGIR 2025!**


## Overview

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **JuDGE** project!

In this repository, you'll find all resources related to the **JuDGE** dataset, including the following:

- The complete dataset and detailed documentation
- Implementations of multiple baseline methods and scripts to reproduce their results
- A one-click evaluation script for quickly assessing the quality of your generated legal documents






## Very Quick Start

1. **Environment Setup**  
   - First, follow the [environment setup instructions](https://github.com/oneal2000/JuDGE?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-setup) in this repository’s README.  

2. **Generate a Judgment Document**  
   - The file `data/text.json` is the test set. Each line is a dictionary with `text_id`, `text` (factual description section), and `fd` (full document).  
   - Your goal is to generate a complete legal document based on the `text` field (facts).  
   - For example, instruct an LLM:  
     > “Please generate a full legal document based on the following facts: [text].”

3. **Save Your Output**  
   - Store your generated document as a list of JSON objects, each with:  
     ```json
     {
       "id": "unique_case_identifier",
       "document": "full generated document text"
     }
     ```

4. **Evaluate**  
   - Assume your results are in `./your_results.json`. CD to the `evaluation` folder, then run:
     ```bash
     cd evaluation
     # Evaluate penalty accuracy, convicting accuracy, referencing accuracy
     python calc.py \
         --gen_file your_results.json \
         --exp_file ../expected.jsonl

     # Evaluate the reasoning and judgment sections
     python calc_rel.py \
         --gen_file your_results.json \
         --exp_file ../expected.jsonl
     ```
   - **Note:** Before running `calc_rel.py`, install NLTK’s WordNet:
     ```python
     import nltk
     nltk.download('wordnet')
     ```

5. **Check Your Environment**  
   - We provide a sample output file. Run the following script from the `evaluation` folder. If there are no errors, your environment is set up correctly:
     ```bash
     python calc.py \
         --gen_file ../Example_Output.jsonl \
         --exp_file ../expected.jsonl
     ```

### Task Definition

Judgment Document Generation is formalized as a conditional text generation problem. Given an input fact description $$f \in \mathcal{F}$$, the goal is to generate a judgment document $$ \hat{j} \in \mathcal{J}$$ that is structurally coherent and legally sound:

$$ \mathcal{M} : \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathcal{J},$$

where $$\hat{j} = \mathcal{M}(f)$$ approximates the ground truth $j$ in terms of content, structure, and legal validity.

## Data Release

This section explains the dataset format, key fields, and where to find the data.

### **Dataset Files**

Our dataset consists of over **100,000** legal judgment documents. Due to the large file size (705.8MB), the full corpus is available at:
 [Google Drive: Full Corpus](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x8HQ1l9yOjt5SFu-5n8kPuEXnqVca-LN/view?usp=sharing)



For ease of use, we provide a **high-quality subset** of judgment documents, which serves as both the training and test set:

- **High-Quality Subset:** [`data/all.json`](https://github.com/JuDGE/tree/main/data/all.json)



The dataset is split into separate **training** and **test** sets:

- **Training Set:** [`data/train.json`](https://github.com/JuDGE/tree/main/data/train.json)
- **Test Set:** [`data/test.json`](https://github.com/JuDGE/tree/main/data/test.json)



Additionally, we offer two **supplementary corpora** that provide external knowledge to enhance judgment document generation:

- **Legal Statutes Corpus:** [`data/law_corpus.jsonl`](https://github.com/JuDGE/tree/main/data/law_corpus.jsonl)

- **Case Corpus (Subset)**:

  `data/case_corpus.jsonl`

  - **Note:** `case_corpus.jsonl` is a subset; the full case corpus is available in the [Google Drive link above](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x8HQ1l9yOjt5SFu-5n8kPuEXnqVca-LN/view?usp=sharing).




- **Data Structure:**
  Each judgment document is structured into a series of key-value pairs. The main fields include:

  - **CaseID:** Unique identifier for the case.
  - **Fact:** A section summarizing the key case facts (limited to 1,000 Chinese characters).
  - **Full Document:** Full Judgment Document.
  - **Reasoning:** Details of the legal reasoning process.
  - **Judgment:** The final decision and penalties (ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 Chinese characters).
  - **Sentence:** Duration of the prison sentence.
  - **Fine:** Monetary penalty imposed.
  - **Crime Type:** The type of crime involved.
  - **Law Articles:** Legal statutes’ indexes in penal codes cited in the judgment.

## Automatic Evaluation

An automated evaluation framework is provided to assess the quality of generated judgment documents across multiple dimensions, including content accuracy, structural coherence, and legal soundness.

- **Evaluation Method:**
  The evaluation uses predefined metrics to compare the generated documents with the ground-truth texts, quantifying performance in terms of legal reasoning and text generation quality.
- **Implementation Details:**
  For more information on the evaluation process, refer to the evaluation Python codes and related documentation within this repository.

### Environment Setup

To get started, follow these steps to configure your environment:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oneal2000/JuDGE.git
   cd JuDGE
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Please note that installing these packages will only enable you to run the evaluation process successfully. If you want to run other parts, including *retriever*, *reranker*, and *baselines*, please refer to the relevant documentation in their respective folders.

### Running the Evaluation Script

To evaluate your generated judgment documents, follow these instructions:

1. **Prepare the Data:**
   Create two JSONL files where each line represents a case in the following format. One file contains ground truth documents, and the other consists of your generated judgment documents.

    ```json
   {
       "id": "unique_case_identifier",
       "document": "ground truth or generated document text"
   }
    ```

2. **Execute the Evaluation Python Code:**

   Before runing `calc_rel.py`, run the following code in your conda environment:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('wordnet')
    ```

   ```bash
    cd evaluation
    # For Penalty Acc. Convicting Acc. Referencing Acc.
    python calc.py \
        --gen_file your_gen_file \
        --exp_file ground_truth_file


   # For Reasoning Section & Judgment Section
    python calc_rel.py \
        --gen_file your_gen_file \
        --exp_file ground_truth_file
   ```

   This requires you to specify the path to the input file and the location for the output results.
   
   **ground_truth_file** is released in `JuDGE/expected.jsonl`





## Necessary Preparations Before Reproduction

If you want to reproduce our baseline results, you need to transform the initial data into the appropriate format. This section is the first and necessary step.

To begin, simply execute:

```bash
cd prepare
./prep.sh
```

This script accomplishes the following:

1. Splits the initial data into two parts: **train** and **test** in a 4:1 ratio
2. Generates `case_corpus.json`, which will be encoded in the `retriever/sailer` section.
3. Generates `dense_train.json`, which is the training file for `retriever`
4. Generates `qrels_file` (test and train respectively), which will be used in the `retriever` and `reranker` sections to evaluate the quality of the retriever and reranker.

Please note that the execution order of the Python codes in this section cannot be reversed. This means that you should run the script `prep.sh` rather than running the codes separately unless you fully understand what the codes mean.

## Retriever & Reranker

This section is necessary if you want to reproduce the baseline results of the `multi-source rag` method. After successfully implementing this section, you will be able to retrieve the most relevant laws and case documents for any query. The main code for this section comes from:
- [Dense Retriever](https://github.com/luyug/Dense)
- [Reranker](https://github.com/luyug/Reranker)
    
Follow the instructions in their README respectively to configure the environments in this section.

- Demo code is provided in the `retriever` and `reranker` folders. You can follow these steps to get started quickly:

    ```bash
    cd retriever
    ./lr.sh
    ./sailer.sh
    cd ../reranker
    ./run.sh
    ```

- Once you have successfully completed the steps above, you can generate an M-RAG train file using the instructions below:

    ```bash
    cd src
    python gen_multi_train.py
    ```
    The generated train_file can be used to train your model and reproduce the `mrag` method baseline.

## Baselines Reproduction

- **LLM Training:**
  Guidelines for fine-tuning both general-purpose and legal-domain large language models, including specific parameter settings.

  - Qwen-series LLMs and Hanfei: The **qwen** template is sufficient to complete this section.
  - LexiLaw: You need to use the **chatglm** template to conduct training and deployment.

  You are supposed to use `data/train.json` to train LLMs.

- **Multi-source RAG:**
  A robust baseline that leverages multi-source retrieval-augmented generation by incorporating external knowledge from both statute and judgment document corpora.

  - You can still use the **qwen** template to train and deploy LLMs similar to methods in LLM training. The difference lies in the different training data.


## Baseline Results
If you have trouble reproducing our experiments step by step, you can simply use the result files we generated in our experiments. We have attached all the result files referenced in our paper. 
```bash
cd baseline_results
./run.sh
```
And you will get all the numbers.
